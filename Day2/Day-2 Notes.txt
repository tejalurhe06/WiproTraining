In C# program will start from the Main() which is the entry point of your project 


class and the object 

what is class -- IT is a blue print of your program structure
what is and object --- Object is a real time entity (has some existence (like its
own properties and behaviour(action -- Method)) )
What is Method -- Method is some set of statements or instructions

for eg:

 public void Display() 
 { 
    int a =10;
    Console.Writeline("Display method called"); 
    }




class Program{                        class Student{

static void Main()                    public void Display(){
{
    // Class reference variable is 
    // pointing to an object
   Student s = new Student();                                 Console.WriteLine("sffhkfh");
     s.Display();
}
                                           }
}

JDK(JVM + class libraries)


All user defined classes Employee , Program  are inherited from using System.Object 
which gives you some predefined methods
like 
ToString()
Equals()
GetHashCode()
GetType()


Control Statements :

which gives the flow of execution in a C# program so there are three types:
1. Sequential  -- step by step
2. Conditional -- Decision based (if/else/switch)
3. Branch Execution-- (break/continue/return)
4. Iterative -- Loops  -- (for/while/do while)


syntax:

int age;
if(age>25)
{
  Console.WriteLine("You are eligible for a loan");
}
else{
 Console.WriteLine("You are not eligible for a loan");

}

//Multiple Conditional
if(age>25)
{
 CWL( you are eligible for loan );
}
else if (age >18)
{

  CWL( you are eligible for loan and voting both);
}
else{

}


if(country == "India")
{

  if(state == "Delhi")
  {

  }
  else
  {

  }
}
else{

}
